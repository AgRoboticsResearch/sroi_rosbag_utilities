# Mask scheme comparison (raw / maskhalf / maskgripper)

This directory compares three pre-ORB-SLAM3 masking strategies and contains the
standalone tooling used for the experiment.

## Pipeline integration status

**The gripper mask is not currently integrated into the canonical pipeline.** The
normal `record_realsense.py -> decode_videos.py -> batches/orbslam_batch_*.sh`
workflow still runs ORB-SLAM3 on the unmasked stereo images at the episode root.
`build_session_schemes.sh` and the other scripts in this directory form a separate
comparison workflow.

The masker writes derived images to `episode_*/maskgripper/`. The existing ORB batch
scripts do not automatically discover that nested directory. Use
`run_orb_scheme.py` for a schemes tree, or explicitly pass the masked directory to
ORB-SLAM3. Making maskgripper the production default requires a separate integration
change to the canonical ORB batch scripts and top-level pipeline documentation.

## Preliminary experiment findings

The original experiment covered 287 episodes from four Vive sessions and two sessions
without Vive. It reported the following results:

| Scheme | Description | Reported result |
|---|---|---|
| `raw` | No mask | Frequent trajectory collapse |
| `maskhalf` | Black out the bottom 38/97 of the image (cutoff 292) | Prevented collapse, with occasional tracking loss |
| `maskgripper` | Per-eye gripper trapezoid plus the bottom 13 rows | Similar quality with fewer reported tracking losses |

- For 278 episodes where both masked schemes tracked fully, the reported median
  maskgripper-versus-maskhalf deviation was 0.5 mm.
- The original summary reported 9 maskhalf losses, 5 maskgripper losses, and 4 episodes
  recovered by maskgripper.

PR #8 fixed accounting bugs that previously omitted complete maskhalf failures and
zero-valued results. Re-run the comparison before treating the historical counts above
as final.

The working hypothesis is that the gripper and AprilTags at the bottom of the frame
produce high-contrast moving features that violate ORB-SLAM's static-scene assumption.

## Manual masking usage

Apply the per-eye gripper mask before running ORB-SLAM:
```bash
python3 schemes_compare/mask_gripper_trapezoid.py <schemes/session/episode-directory>
```

For a schemes directory, the script reads `episode_*/raw/`. For a normal session or
single episode, it reads images from the episode root. Output is always written to
`episode_*/maskgripper/`; it does not overwrite the source images.

Mask geometry for the validated 640x480 D405 rigs:

- Left eye: [(236,292), (417,292), (525,467), (127,467)], plus rows 467 and below.
- Right eye: [(182,292), (365,292), (444,467), (46,467)], plus rows 467 and below.
- The right-eye polygon is shifted left by stereo disparity.

## Full comparison workflow

```bash
# 1) Build raw/maskhalf/maskgripper trees and run ORB for each scheme
MASK_DATA=/path/to/data bash schemes_compare/build_session_schemes.sh 20260709_XXXXXX

# 2) Transform each scheme trajectory for RGB projection
python3 transform_trajectory.py <session>-schemes --recursive

# 3) Render side-by-side comparison videos
python3 schemes_compare/viz_scheme_compare.py <session>-schemes

# 4) Calculate completeness and deviation against maskhalf
python3 schemes_compare/deviation_vs_baseline.py <session>-schemes

# 5) Aggregate results across sessions
python3 schemes_compare/aggregate_schemes.py /path/to/data
```

Outputs are written under `<session>-schemes/_compare/`.

## Files

- `mask_gripper_trapezoid.py`: creates the maskgripper images.
- `mask_session.py`: creates the maskhalf comparison images.
- `schemes_init.py`: builds the per-episode schemes layout.
- `build_session_schemes.sh`: runs the standalone end-to-end comparison workflow.
- `run_orb_scheme.py`: runs ORB-SLAM3 for one scheme.
- `viz_scheme_compare.py`: renders multi-scheme comparison videos.
- `deviation_vs_baseline.py`: computes per-session completeness and deviation.
- `aggregate_schemes.py`: aggregates comparison CSV files across sessions.
- `orb_vs_vive.py`: aligns ORB trajectories with Vive motion capture.

## Notes

- `T_CAM_EE` in `visualization/visualize_traj_video.py` was measured for one rig.
  Verify the projected green point on every different camera/gripper assembly.
- The default data root is `/home/ss/data/1000_onesb_labpicking`. Override it with
  `MASK_DATA`, or pass a data-root argument to `aggregate_schemes.py`.
- `run_orb_scheme.py` defaults to `~/code/ORB_SLAM3`. Override it with
  `ORB_SLAM3_DIR` or `--orbslam-dir`.
- Vive motion capture can become unreliable under occlusion; exclude occluded episodes
  before treating it as a reference.
